# My Process, Thoughts, and Reasoning

## Outline and Duration

- Planning and research: 1 hour
  - Reading through each user story and visualizing how the feature would be shown based on the description.
  - Getting to know the Veeva Help Site: how its structured, the style its taken form, language and tone, and some of the content to get to know the product itself.
  - Understanding the main question: *"What is supposed to be accomplished here?"*
  - By the way it's designed, I chose to add an extra optional step under each sub-heading of **Sections** that it pertains to. I added a link at the end of the step to point towards the new sub-heading under **Sections** to describe the help configuration in more detail. I find this necessary to add that new sub-heading because when the user (the admin) wants to search in the search bar of the help site, they can key in the keywords to get to this particular section much faster and simpler than trying to comb through the steps of the sections themselves (especially if they are adding the help content to existing sections).
- Writing rough draft: 30 minutes
  - Writing the bulk of the procedure and rough draft of the main key points to include in.
- Revision and final: 30 minutes
  - Rewrite to match the style, language, and tone of the help site.
  - Replicate the steps by visualizing with the provided reference site and design description: 
    - *"Does the flow make sense?"*
    - *"Does it address any concerns that the users (admins or users with page layout access) may have?"*
